# DataLens

DataLens AI is an automated platform that connects to enterprise databases (Snowflake,
PostgreSQL, SQL Server) to generate comprehensive, self-updating data dictionaries with zero
manual effort.

The core innovation is our Natural Language Chat Interface, enabling users to ask questions like
"Where is customer churn stored?" and receive instant, context-aware answers. The system also
supports data lineage visualization and incremental updates, ensuring documentation is never
obsolete. Documentation stays current through incremental updates and exports as versioned JSON
or Markdown.
